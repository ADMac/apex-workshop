Additions
=============
- I will do my best to go through the workbook to make a derived class of the workbook exercises prior to the workshop.
- Also, I will do my best to follow along with the code written in the workshop, to commit after. 
- If you have any code you think is helpful to the workshop, please make a pull request and we can see if it's a good fit.
